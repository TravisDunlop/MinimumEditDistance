# Minimum Edit Distance

This repository contains an algorithm to compute minimum weighted edit distance between two strings.  Here the edit distance of two strings is defined as the cost of inserting, deleteting, and substituting characters to transform one string into another.  Each action (insert, delete, substitute) is given a cost I, D, S, respectively.

This was an in class project for the Data Science Masters program at Barcelona Graduate School of Economics completed by Emily (emda3133), Laurits, and Travis (TravisDunlop)
